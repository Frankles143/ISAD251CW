Welcome to the GitHub page for The Winchester pub.

We start the website here, at the home screen. Here you can see we have a good contrast from the navigation bar, footer and the main content. In the main section we have a small piece of intro text, followed by a carousel, showing off a bit more of what The Winchester can offer.

On the navigation bar we have a few easy to reach links for the important bits of our application. We have Food and Drink, Your Order, About Us and the Cart.

Starting at food and drink, where every product is generated from from our database and output into a list for users to view.

![Your Order Screenshot](/Diagrams_and_Screenshots/Screenshots/Chrome_your_order.png?raw=true "Chrome")
Next we have Your Order, which, in an ideal world, you could use to input your order ID and you'd be able to see the status of your order and cancel it if it hadn't been started by the kitchen yet.

![About Us Screenshot](/Diagrams_and_Screenshots/Screenshots/Chrome_about_us.png?raw=true "Chrome")
Moving on to About Us, where we get a small piece of text about The Winchester and an embedded Google Map to help customers find their way.

Finally for the navigation bar we have the shopping cart section, in which users should be able to confirm their orders and get a total.

We have a few more bits tucked away in the footer, with some legal bits, such as the Privacy Policy and also the Picture Credits, in which I credit the royalty-free pictures used for the site. 

![Admin Login Screenshot](/Diagrams_and_Screenshots/Screenshots/Chrome_admin_login.png?raw=true "Chrome")
We also have the admin login, which leads us unto the admin main section. Just hit login, the system for this wasn't finished. 

![Admin Home Screenshot](/Diagrams_and_Screenshots/Screenshots/Chrome_admin_home.png?raw=true "Chrome")
This is the home section for the Admins. You can go to the Orders section to view all the orders that have come in and who they've come in from. You can also see if and when the order was started and completed. This is generated straight from the database. 

![Admin Products Screenshot](/Diagrams_and_Screenshots/Screenshots/Firefox_admin_products.png?raw=true "Firefox")
This last page is where the Admin can view all the products on the system, create new ones, edit and delete them without having to use external software.

Some key features to mention would be:   
The Api, by opening up The_Winchester_API solution and hitting run. You can view /api/users, /api/products, /api/orders.   
The Products page that new products can be made, edited and removed.   
The Orders page that new orders can be made, edited and removed.   
The Food and Drink section that will output all of the products in the database.   
The accessibility of the website in general, as well as the bootstrap layout and resizing features.   
   
Thank you very much for visiting The Winchesters GitHub page, I hope it was to your liking, and have a good day!

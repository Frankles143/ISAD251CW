Welcome to the GitHub page for The Winchester pub.

We start the website here, at the home screen. Here you can see we have a good contrast from the navigation bar, footer and the main content. In the main section we have a small piece of intro text, followed by a carousel, showing off a bit more of what The Winchester can offer.

On the navigation bar we have a few easy to reach links for the important bits of our application. We have Food and Drink, Your Order, About Us and the Cart.

Starting at food and drink, where every product is generated from from our database and output into a list for users to view.

Next we have Your Order, which, in an ideal world, you could use to input your order ID and you'd be able to see the status of your order and cancel it if it hadn't been started by the kitchen yet.

![About Us Screenshot](/Diagrams_and_Screenshots/Screenshots/Chrome_about_us.png?raw=true "Edge")
Moving on to About Us, where we get a small piece of text about The Winchester and an embedded Google Map to help customers find their way.
